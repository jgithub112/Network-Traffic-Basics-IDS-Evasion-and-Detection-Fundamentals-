Scenario

Attackers often attempt to bypass Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to avoid detection during reconnaissance or exploitation. 
This challenge focuses on identifying common IDS evasion techniques and understanding network-level indicators 
used to detect advanced attacks such as session hijacking.

Tools Used

•	TryHackMe learning platform
•	IDS concepts (Snort / Suricata)
•	TCP/IP protocol analysis
•	Network security fundamentals

Process

1.	Studied common techniques attackers use to evade IDS detection.
2.	Analyzed how packet manipulation affects signature-based detection.
3.	Reviewed TCP header fields relevant to session management and security.
4.	Identified indicators that can be monitored to detect hijacking attempts.

Findings

•	Packet fragmentation is a common evasion technique used by attackers to bypass IDS signature matching by splitting malicious payloads across multiple packets.
•	An abnormal or unexpected jump in the TCP sequence number is a key indicator of session hijacking, 
as it suggests unauthorized manipulation or takeover of an established TCP session.
•	The network traffic demonstrates a successful ARP spoofing attack, enabling man-in-the-middle interception.
